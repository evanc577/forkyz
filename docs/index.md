# Online Sources of Puzzles

Many crossword compilers and fans host web pages where puzzles can be
downloaded. Below is a list of sources known to Forkyz. Please [raise an
issue on our GitHub page][issues] if you would like to add a source or
make a correction.

Forkyz will attempt to open any file you give it, but look out for
Across Lite (.puz) or JPZ in particular.
