<p>Thanks for downloading Forkyz&trade; brand crossword puzzle application! The application doesn't include any crossword puzzles out of the box, but it has now begun downloading a puzzles from the last 10 days for you to solve. They will appear in the puzzle list once the downloads are complete, and you will get new puzzles for the day each time you start the app.</p>
